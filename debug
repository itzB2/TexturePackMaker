			Commands               Description
			c                      Continue execution, only stop when a breakpoint is encountered.
			n                      Continue execution until the next line in the current function is reached or
			                       it returns.
			b LINE[ COND|RANGE|c]  Set break at LINE in the current file. If a COND expression is supplied, the
			                       debugger stops at LINE only when COND evaluates to True. If a RANGE 
			                       expression (a expression matching the syntax of Python slices) is supplied,
			                       the debugger stops at LINE only when the hit count of the breakpoint is one
			                       of the numbers generated by RANGE. If letter c appears after LINE, the
			                       breakpoint is cleared.
			s                      Execute the current line, stop at the first possible occasion (either in a
			                       function that is called or in the current function).
			q                      Quit the debugger.
			r                      Continue execution until the current function returns.
			u [LINE]               Without argument, continue execution until the line with a number greater
			                       than the current one is reached.  With a line number, continue execution
			                       until a line with a number greater or equal than LINE is reached. In both
			                       cases, also stop when the current frame returns.
			o                      Move the current frame one level up in the stack trace (to an older frame).
			i                      Move the current frame one level down in the stack trace (to a newer frame).
			h                      Show this help.

			If no command is given, the previous command is repeated.
